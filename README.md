(For Users) Before running the bot you must change the '' empty strings with some meaningful mesaages and some parts where you need to upload audio files and image files to actually make the bot run those 
commands but most importantly you must download ffmpeg and then add it to your path (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMEP82yrs5g) this video will help you and after you added ffmpeg to your path you must use 
a token to run the code for that you must make an application for your bot in discord developer portal and then give administrator in both the bot page and the OAuth2 page after you've done all of that 
the only thing that has left is to make a server or if you have a server add it into the server than run the code in an IDE of your choice (pycharm is a good choice) ,,,, HAVE FUN

(For Devs) If anyone has any suggestions on developing and making the bot better with some unique features follow me and lets develop it together (I'm a little new at GitHub)
